INHALE EXHAUST was created for [SMOG](http://www.s-m-o-g.net/) an online multimedia publication by [Sarah Rothberg](http://sarahrothberg.com/) and [Ben Kauffman](http://www.benkauffman.com/) in March of 2014. 

The idea is pretty simple: hit 'e' to output exhaust from the car which goes into the atmosphere and distorts the music. Hit 'i' to inhale that smog and clean up the back track.
